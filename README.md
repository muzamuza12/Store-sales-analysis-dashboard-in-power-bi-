# **Store Sales Analysis Dashboard in Power BI**

This repository features my latest project—a Power BI dashboard that provides a detailed analysis of store sales. This project is my first venture into using Power BI for comprehensive business analysis, and I'm excited to share the insights and techniques I've developed.

## **Project Overview**

The dashboard covers a wide range of analyses essential for understanding store performance. Here’s what you’ll find:

### **Key Analyses:**
- **Total Sales, Cost, Profit & Profit Percentage**: Core metrics that give a complete picture of financial performance.
- **Product Categorization**: Classified products into *losing products*, *normal products*, and *top products* based on their profit margins.
- **State-Wise & Region-Wise Analysis**: Geographic breakdowns to identify top-performing areas.
- **Top 10 Products by Segment & Sales**: A deep dive into the best-selling products across different segments.
- **Shipping Mode Analysis**: Evaluated the effectiveness of various shipping methods.
- **Yearly Sales & Profit Trends**: Analysis of sales and profit growth on a yearly basis.
- **Average Percentage of Products**: Examined how products perform relative to each other within the portfolio.

### **Technical Details:**
- **DAX Queries**: Used extensively for creating calculated columns, measures, and conditional categorizations.
- **Power Query**: Transformed raw data into a structured format suitable for detailed analysis.

## **Future Enhancements**
As this is my first Power BI project, I am eager to continue learning and improving. I plan to expand this dashboard with more advanced analytics and visualizations. Feedback and suggestions are highly encouraged!

## **Usage Instructions**
